# Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description

This application was made for developers who want to create notes or code snippets with or without internet connection and reliably retrieve them later on for use. This app was made using PWA technologies such as IndexedDB database, caching with workbox, babel for use of async/await and manifests using the webpack pwa manifest plug-in.
